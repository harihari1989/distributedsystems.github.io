# Distributed Systems Visual Guide

A professional-grade, visual reference for distributed systems and system design interviews.
Each page focuses on a concrete pattern with failure modes, trade-offs, and real-world usage.
Diagrams use Mermaid and interactive visuals are inline where they add intuition.

## Core Topics
- [Compute patterns](pages/compute-patterns.md)
- [Storage and data patterns](pages/database-architectures.md)
- [Consistency models](pages/consistency-models.md)
- [Networking patterns](pages/networking-patterns.md)
- [Kubernetes and deployment](pages/kubernetes-patterns.md)
- [System design interview patterns](pages/system-design-patterns.md)

## How to Use This Guide
- Start with compute patterns to align on workload and scaling primitives.
- Use the storage and consistency pages to reason about data trade-offs.
- Cross-link into networking and Kubernetes when you need operational detail.
